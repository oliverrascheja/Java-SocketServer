# Java Socket Server

A lightweight, multi-threaded **Java Socket Server & Client** application for communication over a local area network.  
Built entirely with **native Java (no external libraries required)**.  

This project demonstrates my skills in **network programming, multithreading, and client/server architecture**.

## Key Features

### Client
- User-to-User Chat  
- Private messaging with a specific user  
- Group Chat support (server-side implemented, client-side planned) 
- Manual configuration of server IP  

### Server
- Broadcast messages to all connected users  
- Admin command console with interactive commands  
- Manage group chats and group members  
- User statistics and traffic logging  
- Responds to client requests 
- Kick all clients on server shutdown

## Getting Started

### Run the Client

```bash
cd client/src
make run
```

### Run the Server

```bash
cd server/src
make run
```

---

### Example Usage

Start the server:
```bash
java -cp server/src Server
```

Connect a client:
```bash
java -cp client/src Client
```

When the client is running, Send a message to another user (or use any other command listed above):
```bash
alice: Hello Bob!
```

Request the current server time:
```bash
get time
```

### Architecture Overview

Multiple clients connect to a single SocketServer within the same local area network.

### Motivation

This project is a showcase of my expertise in:
- Java programming
- Networking with sockets
- Multithreaded server design
- Command parsing & protocol design
- Clean separation of client/server logic

It demonstrates my ability to build scalable, maintainable backend systems in Java.
Skills demonstrated: Java, Socket Programming, Multithreading, Client/Server Design, Protocol Design
